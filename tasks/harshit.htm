                title="Not a fork via the Fork function on top." style="cursor:help">ZIP</span> file using the Export
            button at the bottom. Save the file as {Your_Name}.zip, double-check your work & send it back to us.</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Position the element <span class="code">#feedback</span> at the bottom right of the browser window,
                leaving a 5 pixel gap on the right and bottom, keeping its original size. Make sure that any changes to
                the <span class="code">.unknownCSS</span> selector won't affect your changes made to the <span
                    class=code>#feedback element.</li>

            <li>Using vanilla Javascript, loop through the object
                <pre>{q1:89, q2:75, q3:88}</pre> and show the key/entry pairs in a table like <span
                    class="code">#sampleTbl</span> (appended before the text "footer" inside the <span
                    class="code">&lt;I&gt;</span> tag at the bottom). <br>HINT: you can modify the content of the <span
                    class="code">&lt;I&gt;</span> element to help with this</li>

            <li>Using vanilla Javascript, add the following behavior to the <span class="code">#feedback</span> element:
                Toggle its color between the current color and yellow on each click</li>
            <li><b>Bonus:</b> Prevent the form <span class="code">form</span> from submitting when clicking <button
                    type="submit">submit</button> unless <input name="name" type="text" placeholder="[a-zA-Z0-9] only">
                contains an alphanumeric string without spaces
            </li>
        </ol>

Please consider creating a fork of your solved HTML before proceeding with improvements of the code, and submitting both - 1) solved problems: 1,2,3, bonus 2) solved: bonus2. After downloading your ZIP archive, be sure to double-check your work in your favorite editor. CodePen can be tricky ;-) Good luck! -->
